To do this animation, I watched this tutorial:

We need 2 files to do it: 
- style.css
- index.html

To connect the CSS file to HTML file, we have to link it in the head of the HTML file using `link` element and put the name of the css file in the `href` attribute:

Then, to make the cup, we are going to use `div` and `span`. The `div` is to make the cup of the and the tea, and `span` is to make the vapour effect. In the div, we have to use the `class` attribute, with that we can style the differents `container` to make the form of the cup and the tea. To style the element span, we have to use `style` attribute. If you see the CSS file, you can see the name of the different `containers` that we use in the attributes, also, you can see the colors, shape and size of each class... Of course you can change the color and size if you think it's necessary.
